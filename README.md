# Homelessness in India is on the rise.
 Many people are turning to the streets as a place to sleep and find income by performing hard labor. Children living on the street are also becoming very common for many reasons, including abuse and family abandonment.
Factors that contribute to homelessness include **impairment, a shortage of housing affordability, irregular or long-term unemployment and shifts in business.**

Homeless people have **very little access to healthcare services.** The absence of proper identification documentation needed by hospitals, the expenses and the tendency of physicians to openly reject them are just a few of the factors. 
Children who end up on the street are often subjected to neglect and physical and emotional abuse at home. Once on the street, children experience trafficking and/or heavy labor as they flee their families in hopes of a new life.
